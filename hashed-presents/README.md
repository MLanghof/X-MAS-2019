>  The MechaGnomes recived an upgrade this year, they got a new present
>  recognition software that uses some amazing hashing algorithm. The hash is
>  super fast, but we aren't really sure it's cryptographically secure, if you
>  can proove that the hash function is flawed you'll recive a present (that's
>  not hashed ofcourse).
