# X-MAS 2019 CTF Writeups

Here are all the writeups for everything Redstone Blockchain did in the [X-MAS
2019 CTF][1]! We participated as a small team of 7 with most of us pretty new to
doing CTFs. Despite our lack of traditional experience many of us had skills
that instantly translated into flags and we managed to snatch up a few stars
being the first to solve some challenges!

## Categories

* **Sanity Checks:** Merry Christmas! And a warm welcome to X-MAS CTF from our
  team. We hope you'll enjoy this year's edition :) In this category you have
  some simple flags that show you how the platform works.
* **Binary Exploitation:** Binaries, or executables, are machine code for a
  computer to execute. For the most part, the binaries that you will face in
  CTFs are Linux ELF files or the occasional windows executable. Binary
  Exploitation is a broad topic within Cyber Security which really comes down to
  finding a vulnerability in the program and exploiting it to gain control of a
  shell or modifying the program's functions.
* **Cryptography:** Cryptography is the science of protecting messages behind
  algorithms that rely on special mathematical properties. Those algorithms,
  known as encryption schemes, can sometimes use insecure mathematics or can be
  implemented in a sloppy way. Some good places to start learning crypto can be
  found [here][2] and [here][3]. Sometimes, you just need to use your googling
  skills and other times your brain will melt down from all the math you'll
  encounter.
* **Emulation:** No descroption was provided
